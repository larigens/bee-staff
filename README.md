## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!

### Prerequisites

This package requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), npm, Inquirer, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) installed on your machine. You can install these by running the code below on your terminal:

For `npm`

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

For `Node.js`

```bash
npm i node@lts
```

For `Express.js`

```bash
npm i express
```

### Setting Up

Open the project in VS Code and make sure you are in the directory of this application before installing `Inquirer`, `MySQL2` and `Console Table Package`. To install it, type the commands below on your terminal:

For `Inquirer`
```bash
npm install --save inquirer@^8.2.5
```

For `MySQL2`
```bash
npm i mysql2
```

For `Console Table Package`
```bash
npm i console.table
```

**Note: Be sure to download this version, because newer versions no longer use the commonjs syntax require('inquirer').**

You can also open the project in VS Code and make sure you are in the directory of this application and then type the command below on your terminal:

```bash
npm i
```

Once you run this, npm will begin the installation process of all of the current project's dependencies.

## Mock-Up
